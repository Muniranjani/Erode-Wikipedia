        <h2><u>About Periyar</u></h2>

        <font size="4">
            <p>In this Indian name, the toponymic surname is Erode. It is not a family name, and the person
                should be referred to by the given name, Ramasamy.
                In this Indian name, the name Venkatappa is a patronymic, and the person should be referred to by the
                given name, Ramasamy.</p>
            <p> Erode Venkatappa Ramasamy (17 September 1879 – 24 December 1973), revered by his followers as Periyar[a]
                or Thanthai[b] Periyar, was an Indian social activist and politician who started the Self-Respect
                Movement and Dravidar Kazhagam. He is known as the 'Father of the Dravidian movement'. He rebelled
                against Brahmin dominance and gender and caste inequality in Tamil Nadu. Since 2021, the Indian
                state of Tamil Nadu celebrates his birth anniversary as 'Social Justice Day'.</p>

            <p>Ramasamy joined the Indian National Congress in 1919. In 1924, Ramasamy participated in non-violent
                agitation (satyagraha) involving Mahatma Gandhi in Vaikom, Travancore. He resigned from the Congress
                in 1925 when he felt that the party was only serving the interests of Brahmins. He questioned what he
                felt was the subjugation of non-Brahmin Dravidians as Brahmins enjoyed gifts and donations from
                non-Brahmins but opposed and discriminated against non-Brahmins in cultural and religious matters. He
                declared his stance to be "no god, no religion, no Gandhi, no Congress, and no Brahmins".</p>

            <p> He founded Self-Respect Movement in 1926. From 1929 to 1932 Ramasamy made a tour of British Malaya,
                Europe, and Soviet Union which influenced him. In 1939, Ramasamy became the head of the Justice
                Party,[c] and in 1944, he changed its name to Dravidar Kazhagam. The party later split with one group
                led by C. N. Annadurai forming the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1949.While continuing the
                Self-Respect Movement, he advocated for an independent Dravida Nadu (land of the Dravidians).</p>

            <p> Ramasamy promoted the principles of rationalism, self-respect, women's rights and eradication of caste.
                He opposed the exploitation and marginalisation of the non-Brahmin Dravidian people of South India and
                the imposition of what he considered Indo-Aryan India.</p>

        <font size="5" color=" #08708f"><u>Biography</u></font>
    </h3>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Early years</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Erode Venkata Ramasamy was born on 17 September 1879 to a Kannada Balija merchant family
            in Erode, then a part of the Coimbatore district of the Madras Presidency.[16] Ramasamy's father was
            Venkatappa Nayakar (or Venkata), and his mother was Chinnathyee Muthammal. He had one elder brother named
            Krishnaswamy and two sisters named Kannamma and Ponnuthoy. He later came to be known as "Periyar",
            meaning 'respected one' or 'elder' in Tamil.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy married when he was 19, and had a daughter who lived for only 5 months. His first wife,
            Nagammai,
            died in 1933. Ramasamy married for a second time in July 1948. His second wife, Maniammai, continued
            Ramasamy's social work after his death in 1973, and his ideas then were advocated by Dravidar Kazhagam.
        </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1929, Ramasamy announced the deletion of his caste title Naicker from his name at the First
            Provincial
            Self-Respect Conference of Chengalpattu. He could speak three Dravidian languages: Kannada, Telugu and
            Tamil. Ramasamy attended school for five years after which he joined his father's trade
            at the age of 12. He used to listen to Tamil Vaishnavite gurus who gave discourses in his house enjoying his
            father's hospitality. At a young age, he began questioning the apparent contradictions in the Hindu
            mythological stories. As Ramasamy grew, he felt that people used religion only as a mask to deceive
            innocent people and therefore took it as one of his duties in life to warn people against superstitions and
            priests.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Kashi pilgrimage Incident</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1904, Ramasamy went on a pilgrimage to Kashi to visit the revered Shiva temple of Kashi
            Vishwanath.
            Though regarded as one of the holiest sites of Hinduism, he witnessed immoral activities such as begging and
            floating dead bodies. His frustrations extended to functional Hinduism in general, when he experienced
            what he called "Brahmanic exploitation".</font>
    </p>

    <p>
        <font size="4">However, one particular alleged incident in Kasi had a profound impact on Ramasamy's ideology and
            future
            work. At the worship site, there were free meals offered to guests. To Ramasamy's shock, he was refused
            meals at choultries, which exclusively fed Brahmins. Due to extreme hunger, Ramasamy felt compelled to enter
            one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a sacred thread on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his
            moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not
            permitted by the Hindu shastras to have moustaches. He not only prevented Ramasamy's entry but also pushed
            him rudely into the street.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">As his hunger became intolerable, Ramasamy was forced to feed on leftovers from the streets.
            Around this
            time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South
            India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Ramasamy's regard for Hinduism, for the events he
            had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy place
            which welcomed all. Ramasamy was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he
            became an atheist.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Member of Congress (1919–1925)</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy joined the Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his business and resigning
            from public
            posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs
            spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating
            untouchability. In 1921, Ramasamy courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife as
            well as his sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a
            compromise. He was again arrested during the Non-Cooperation movement and the Temperance movement. In
            1922, Ramasamy was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur
            session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were
            defeated in the Congress party due to discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in
            1925.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Vaikom Satyagraha (1924–1925)</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Vaikom Satyagraha was a nonviolent agitation for access to the prohibited public environs of the
            Vaikom
            Temple in the Kingdom of Travancore by the Congress Party. Kingdom of Travancore was known for its rigid and
            oppressive caste system and hence Swami Vivekananda called Travancore a "lunatic asylum".</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In Vaikom, a small town in Kerala state, then Travancore, there were strict laws of
            untouchability in and
            around the temple area. Dalits, also known as Harijans, were not allowed into the close streets around and
            leading to the temple, let alone inside it. Anti-caste feelings were growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen
            as a suitable place for an organised Satyagraha. Under his guidance a movement had already begun with the
            aim of giving all castes the right to enter the temples. Thus, agitations and demonstrations took place.
        </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy was invited to lead the movement as he was the President of the Madras Presidency
            Congress. On 14 April, Ramasamy and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom. They were immediately
            arrested and imprisoned for participation. Ramasamy and his followers continued to give support to the
            movement until it was withdrawn during which he was arrested again.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The way in which the Vaikom Satyagraha events have been recorded provides a clue to the image of
            the
            respective organisers. In an article entitle Gandhi and Ambedkar, A Study in Leadership, Eleanor Zelliot
            relates the 'Vaikom Satyagraha', including Gandhi's negotiations with the temple authorities in relation to
            the event. Furthermore, the editor of Ramasamy's Thoughts states that Brahmins purposely suppressed news
            about Ramasamy's participation. A leading Congress magazine, Young India, in its extensive reports on Vaikom
            never mentions Ramasamy.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">After the intervention of Mahatma Gandhi, the agitation was given up and a compromise was reached
            with the
            Regent Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, who released all those arrested and opened the north, south, and west public
            roads leading to Vaikom Mahadeva Temple to all castes. However, she refused to open the eastern road. The
            compromise was criticized by Ramasamy. Only in 1936, after the Temple Entry Proclamation, was access to the
            eastern road and entry into the temple allowed to the lower castes. In 1925 the Madras Presidency
            Congress passed an unanimous resolution hailing Ramasamy as Vaikom Veerar or Hero of Vaikom in the
            Kanchipuram Session.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Self-Respect Movement</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy and his followers campaigned constantly to influence and pressure the government to take
            measures
            to remove social inequality (abolish untouchability, manual scavenging system etc.) even while other
            nationalist forerunners focused on the struggle for political independence. The Self-Respect Movement was
            described from the beginning as "dedicated to the goal of giving non-Brahmins a sense of pride based on
            their Dravidian past".</font>

            <h4>Ramasamy during the early years of Self-Respect Movement</h4></center>
        
       <p> <font size="4">In 1952, the Ramasamy Self-Respect Movement Institution was registered with a list of objectives
            of the
            institution from which may be quoted as

            for the diffusion of useful knowledge of political education; to allow people to live a life of freedom from
            slavery to anything against reason and self respect; to do away with needless customs, meaningless
            ceremonies, and blind superstitious beliefs in society; to put an end to the present social system in which
            caste, religion, community and traditional occupations based on the accident of birth, have chained the mass
            of the people and created "superior" and "inferior" classes... and to give people equal rights; to
            completely eradicate untouchability and to establish a united society based on brother/sisterhood; to give
            equal rights to women; to prevent child marriages and marriages based on law favourable to one sect, to
            conduct and encourage love marriages, widow marriages, inter caste and inter-religious marriages and to have
            the marriages registered under the Civil Law; and to establish and maintain homes for orphans and widows and
            to run educational institutions.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Propagation of the philosophy of self-respect became the full-time activity of Ramasamy since
            1925. A
            Tamil weekly Kudi Arasu started in 1925, while the English journal Revolt started in 1928 carried on the
            propaganda among the English educated people.[50] The Self-Respect Movement began to grow fast and received
            the sympathy of the heads of the Justice Party from the beginning. In May 1929, a conference of Self-Respect
            Volunteers was held at Pattukkotai under the presidency of S. Guruswami. K.V. Alagiriswami took charge as
            the head of the volunteer band. Conferences followed in succession throughout the Tamil districts of the
            former Madras Presidency. A Self-Respect training school was opened at Erode, the home town of Ramasamy. The
            object was not just to introduce social reform but to bring about a social revolution to foster a new spirit
            and build a new society</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">International travel (1929–1932)</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Between 1929 and 1935, under the strain of the Great Depression, political thinking worldwide
            received a
            jolt from the spread of international communism. Indian political parties, movements and considerable
            sections of leadership were also affected by inter-continental ideologies. The Self-Respect Movement also
            came under the influence of the leftist philosophies and institutions. Ramasamy, after establishing the
            Self-Respect Movement as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and
            socially. To accomplish this, he studied the history and politics of different countries, and personally
            observed these systems at work.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy toured Malaya for a month, from December 1929 to January 1930, to propagate the
            self-respect
            philosophy. Embarking on his journey from Nagapattinam with his wife Nagammal and his followers, Ramasamy
            was received by 50,000[citation needed] Tamil Malaysians in Penang. During the same month, he inaugurated
            the Tamils Conference, convened by the Tamils Reformatory Sangam in Ipoh, and then went to Singapore. In
            December 1931 he undertook a tour of Europe, accompanied by S. Ramanathan and Erode Ramu, to personally
            acquaint himself with their political systems, social movements, way of life, economic and social progress
            and administration of public bodies. He visited Egypt, Greece, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Germany, England,
            Spain, France and Portugal, staying in Russia for three months. On his return journey he halted at Ceylon
            and returned to India in November 1932.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The tour shaped the political ideology of Ramasamy to achieve the social concept of Self-Respect.
            The
            communist system in the Soviet Union appealed to him as appropriately suited to deal with the social ills of
            the country. Thus, on socio-economic issues Ramasamy was Marxist, but he did not advocate for abolishing
            private ownership. Immediately after his return, Ramasamy, in alliance with the enthusiastic communist,
            M. Singaravelar, began to work out a socio-political scheme incorporating socialist and self-respect ideals.
            This marked a crucial stage of development in the Self-Respect Movement which got politicised and found its
            compatibility in Tamil Nadu.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Opposition to Hindi</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1937, when Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari became the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency, he
            introduced
            Hindi as a compulsory language of study in schools, thereby igniting a series of anti-Hindi agitations.
            Tamil nationalists, the Justice Party under Sir A. T. Panneerselvam, and Ramasamy organised anti-Hindi
            protests in 1938 which ended with numerous arrests by the Rajaji government.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">During the same year, the slogan "Tamil Nadu for Tamilians" was first used by Ramasamy in
            protest
            against the introduction of Hindi in schools. He claimed that the introduction of Hindi was a dangerous
            mechanism used by the Aryans to infiltrate Dravidian culture. He reasoned that the adoption of Hindi
            would make Tamils subordinate to the Hindi-speaking North Indians. Ramasamy claimed that Hindi would not
            only halt the progress of Tamil people, but would also completely destroy their culture and nullify the
            progressive ideas that had been successfully inculcated through Tamil in the recent decades.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Cutting across party lines, South Indian politicians rallied together in their opposition to
            Hindi.
            There were recurrent anti-Hindi agitations in 1948, 1952 and 1965.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">As President of the Justice Party (1938–1944)</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">A political party known as the South Indian Libertarian Federation (commonly referred to as
            Justice Party)
            was founded in 1916, principally to oppose the economic and political power of the Brahmin groups. The
            party's goal was to render social justice to the non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses,
            non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical
            priesthood and Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy were blamed for the existence of inequalities among
            non-Brahmin caste groups.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1937, when the government required that Hindi be taught in the school system, Ramasamy
            organised
            opposition to this policy through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable
            support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played a big role in the politics of
            Tamil Nadu. The fear of the Hindi language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins.
            To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi in the school system was a form of bondage. When the Justice Party
            weakened in the absence of mass support, Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed
            for opposing Hindi in 1939. Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative
            members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Dravidar Kazhagam (1944–onwards)</font>
    </h4>
    <h5>
        <font>Formation of the Dravidar Kazhagam</font>
    </h5>
    <p>
        <font size="4">At a rally in 1944, Ramasamy, in his capacity as the leader of the Justice Party, declared that
            the party
            would henceforth be known as the Dravidar Kazhagam, or "Dravidian Association". However, a few who disagreed
            with Ramasamy started a splinter group, claiming to be the original Justice Party. This party was led by
            veteran Justice Party leader P. T. Rajan and survived until 1957.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The Dravidar Kazhagam came to be well known among the urban communities and students. Villages
            were
            influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood,
            were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded
            as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack. From 1949 onwards, the Dravidar Kazhagam
            intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the
            degeneration of Dravidians. The Dravidar Kazhagam vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability
            amongst the Dalits. It also focused its attention on the liberation of women, women's education, willing
            marriage, widow marriage, orphanages and mercy homes.</font>
    </p>
    <h5>
        <font>Split with Annadurai</font>
    </h5>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1949, Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai, established a separate
            association
            called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation. This was due to
            differences between the two, while Ramasamy advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state,
            Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, at the same time claiming increased state independence.
            Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social
            evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating
            from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political
            power, they would lose vigour and a sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a
            different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. Thus, when
            Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam, stating that Ramasamy married
            Maniammayar who was the daughter of Kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with
            Ramasamy joined the DMK. Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam, the organisation made efforts to
            carry on Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that
            the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content, and thus was a key which opened the
            door to subjects to be learned. The Dravidar Kazhagam continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan
            propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of self-determination.</font>

    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1956, despite warnings from P. Kakkan, the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee,
            Ramasamy
            organised a procession to the Marina to burn pictures of the Hindu God Rama. Ramasamy was subsequently
            arrested and confined to prison.</font>

    <p>
        <font size="4">The activities of Ramasamy continued when he went to Bangalore in 1958 to participate in the All
            India
            Official Language Conference. There he stressed the need to retain English as the Union Official Language
            instead of Hindi. Five years later, Ramasamy travelled to North India to advocate the eradication of the
            caste system. In his last meeting at Thiagaraya Nagar, Chennai on 19 December 1973, Ramasamy declared a call
            for action to gain social equality and a dignified way of life. On 24 December 1973, Ramasamy died at the
            age of 94.</font>

    <h3>
        <font size="5" color=" #08708f"><u>Principles and legacy</u></font>
    </h3>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy spent over fifty years giving speeches, propagating the realisation that everyone is an
            equal
            citizen and the differences on the basis of caste and creed were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant
            as underdogs in the society. Although Ramasamy's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more
            mundane masses, scores of educated people were also swayed. Ramasamy viewed reasoning as a special tool.
            According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Ramasamy used reasoning with
            respect to subjects of social interest in his presentations to his audiences. Communal differences in
            Tamil society were considered by many to be deep-rooted features until Ramasamy came to the scene</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Rationalism</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The bedrock of Ramasamy's principles and the movements that he started was rationalism. He
            thought that an
            insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority and trying to keep it in a subordinate
            position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to
            realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise
            that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others
            and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Likewise, Ramasamy explained that wisdom lies in thinking and that the spear-head of thinking is
            rationalism. On caste, he stated that no other living being harms or degrades its own class. But man, said
            to be a rational living being, does these evils. The differences, hatred, enmity, degradation, poverty and
            wickedness now prevalent in society are due to lack of wisdom and rationalism and not due to God or the
            cruelty of time. Ramasamy had written in his books and magazines dozens of times of various occasions that
            British rule is better than self-rule</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy also blamed the capitalists for their control of machinery, creating difficulties for
            the
            workers. According to his philosophy, rationalism, which ought to lead the way to a peaceful life for all,
            had resulted in causing poverty and anxiety among the people due to dominating forces. He stated that there
            is no use to simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one lacks self-respect or scientific knowledge.
            An example he gave was the West sending messages to the planets, while the Tamil society in India were
            sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through the Brahmins.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In a message to the Brahmin community, Ramasamy stated, "in the name of god, religion, and
            sastras you
            have duped us. We were the ruling people. Stop this life of cheating us from this year. Give room for
            rationalism and humanism".[66] He added that "any opposition not based on rationalism, science, or
            experience will one day or another, reveal the fraud, selfishness, lies and conspiracies"</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Self-respect</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy's philosophy of self-respect was based on his image of an ideal world and a universally
            accepted
            one. His philosophy preaches that human actions should be based on rational thinking. Further, the outcome
            of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a
            spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the
            philosophy of self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should
            follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under all circumstances.
            Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'.
            There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy's foremost appeal to people was to develop self-respect. He preached that the Brahmins
            had
            monopolised and cheated other communities for decades and deprived them of self-respect. He stated that most
            Brahmins claimed to belong to a "superior" community with the reserved privilege of being in charge of
            temples and performing archanas. He felt that they were trying to reassert their control over religion by
            using their superior caste status to claim the exclusive privilege to touch idols or enter the sanctum
            sanctorum.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Women's rights</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">As a rationalist and ardent social reformer, Ramasamy advocated forcefully throughout his life
            that women
            should be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men, that they should be provided good
            education and have the right to property. He thought that age and social customs were not a bar to marrying
            women. He was keen that women should realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy fought against the orthodox traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu
            and
            throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though arranged marriages were meant to enable a couple to live
            together throughout life, it was manipulated to enslave women. Much worse was the practice of child
            marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed that it would be a sin to marry after
            puberty. Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the dowry system where the bride's family is
            supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly
            wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this
            abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, led to dowry
            deaths. There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and
            burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Ramasamy
            fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Women in India also did not have rights to their families' or husbands' property. Ramasamy fought
            fiercely
            for this and also advocated for women to have the right to separate or divorce their husbands under
            reasonable circumstances. While birth control remained taboo in society of Ramasamy's time, he advocated
            for it not only for the health of women and population control, but for liberation of women.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">He criticised the hypocrisy of chastity for women and argued that it should either apply also to
            men, or
            not at all for both genders. While fighting against this, Ramasamy advocated getting rid of the Devadasi
            system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women, attaching them to temples for the
            entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes. Further, for the liberation of women, Ramasamy
            pushed for their right to have an education and to join the armed services and the police force.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">According to biographer M.D. Gopalakrishnan, Ramasamy and his movement achieved a better status
            for women
            in Tamil society. Ramasamy held that, in matters of education and employment, there should be no difference
            between men and women. Gopalakrishnan states that Ramasamy's influence in the State departments and even the
            Center made it possible for women to join police departments and the army. Ramasamy also spoke out against
            child marriage.</font>

            <font>Ramasamy on postal stamp of India, issued in 2009</font>
        </h4>
    </center>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy wanted thinking people to see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of
            reform. He
            wanted the government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly
            adopt measures to remove them. Ramasamy's philosophy did not differentiate social and political
            service. According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently,
            and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Ramasamy stated that while Christian and
            Islamic religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for social
            progress. He argued that the government was not for the people, but, in a "topsy-turvy" manner, the people
            were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the social system contrived for the
            advantage of a small group of people</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">One of the areas of Ramasamy's focus was on the upliftment of rural communities. In a booklet
            called
            Village Uplift, Ramasamy pleaded for rural reform. At that time rural India still formed the largest part of
            the Indian subcontinent, in spite of the ongoing process of urbanisation. Thus, the distinction between
            rural and urban had meant an economic and social degradation for rural inhabitants. Ramasamy wanted to
            eradicate the concept of "village" as a discriminatory word among places, similar to the concept of
            "outcast" among social groups. Ramasamy advocated for a location where neither the name nor the situation or
            its conditions imply differences among people. He further advocated for the modernisation of villages by
            providing public facilities such as schools, libraries, radio stations, roads, bus transport, and police
            stations</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy felt that a small number of cunning people created caste distinctions to dominate Indian
            society,
            so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions
            rationally. According to Ramasamy, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that the caste system
            had been stifling self-respect and therefore he or she would strive to get rid of this menace.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy stated that the caste system in South India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked with
            the
            arrival of Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a different stratification
            of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of
            living. Ramasamy also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of
            rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered
            to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The Samathuvapuram (Equality Village) social equality system introduced by the Government of
            Tamil Nadu in
            the late 1990s is named after Ramasamy.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Tamil language and writing</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy claimed that Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, and Kannada came from the same mother language of
            Old
            Tamil. He explained that the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four
            different Dravidian states. Nevertheless, current understanding of Dravidian languages contradicts such
            claims. For example, the currently known classification of Dravidian languages provides the following
            distinct classes: Southern (including Tamil–Malayalam, Kannada and Tulu); Central (including Telugu–Kui and
            Kolami–Parji); and, Northern (including Kurukh–Malto and Brahui).</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">With relation to writing, Ramasamy stated that using the Tamil script about the arts, which are
            useful to
            the people in their life and foster knowledge, talent and courage, and propagating them among the masses,
            will enlighten the people. Further, he explained that it will enrich the language, and thus it can be
            regarded as a zeal for Tamil. Ramasamy also stated that if words of North Indian origin (Sanskrit) are
            removed from Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, only Tamil will be left. On the Brahmin usage of Tamil, he
            stated that the Tamil spoken by the Andhras and the Malayali people was far better than the Tamil spoken by
            the Brahmins. Ramasamy believed that Tamil language will make the Dravidian people unite under the banner of
            Tamil culture, and that it will make the Kannadigas, Andhras and the Malayalees be vigilant. With regards to
            a Dravidian alliance under a common umbrella language, Ramasamy stated that "a time will come for unity.
            This will go on until there is an end to the North Indian domination. We shall reclaim an independent
            sovereign state for us".</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">At the same time, Ramasamy was also known to have made controversial remarks on the Tamil
            language and
            people from time to time. On one occasion, he referred to the Tamil people as "barbarians" and the Tamil
            language as the "language of barbarians". However, Anita Diehl explains that Ramasamy
            made these remarks on Tamil because it had no respective feminine verbal forms.But Anita Diehl's
            explanation doesn't match with Ramasamy's own explanation. Ramasamy himself explained the reasons many times
            in his speeches and writings, for instance, an excerpt from his book Thamizhum, Thamizharum(Tamil and Tamil
            people) reads, "I say Tamil as barbarian language. Many get angry with me for saying so. But no one ponders
            over why I say so. They say Tamil is a 3,000 to 4,000 years-old language and they boast about this.
            Precisely that is what the reason why I call Tamil as barbarian language. People should understand the term
            primitive and barbarism. What was the status of people living 4,000 years ago and now? We are just blindly
            sticking to old glories. No one has come forward to reform Tamil language and work for its growth."</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4"> Ramasamy's ideas on Tamil alphabet reforms included those such as the reasons for the vowel 'ஈ'
            (i)
            having a cursive and looped representation of the short form 'இ' (I).[clarification needed] In stone
            inscriptions from 400 or 500 years ago, many Tamil letters are found in other shapes. As a matter of
            necessity and advantage to cope with printing technology, Ramasamy thought that it was sensible to change a
            few letters, reduce the number of letters, and alter a few signs. He further explained that the older and
            more divine a language and its letters were said to be, the more they needed reform. Because of changes
            brought about by means of modern transport and international contact, and happenings that have attracted
            words and products from many countries, foreign words and their pronunciations have been assimilated into
            Tamil quite easily. Just as a few compound characters have separate signs to indicate their length as in '
            கா ', ' கே ' (kA:, kE:), Ramasamy questioned why other compound characters like ' கி ', ' கீ ', 'கு ', ' கூ
            ' (kI, ki:, kU, ku:) (indicated integrally as of now), shouldn't also have separate signs. Further, changing
            the shape of letters, creating new symbols and adding new letters and similarly, dropping those that are
            redundant, were quite essential according to Ramasamy. Thus, the glory and excellence of a language and its
            script depend on how easily they can be understood or learned and on nothing else"</font>

    <h4>
        <font size="4">Thoughts on the Thirukkural</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy hailed the Thirukkural as a valuable scripture which contained many scientific and
            philosophical
            truths. He also praised the secular nature of the work. Ramasamy praised Thiruvalluvar for his description
            of God as a formless entity with only positive attributes. He also suggested that one who reads the
            Thirukkural will become a Self-respecter, absorbing knowledge in politics, society, and economics. According
            to him, though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate to today, it permitted such
            changes for modern society.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">On caste, he believed that the Kural illustrates how Vedic laws of Manu were against the Sudras
            and other
            communities of the Dravidian race. On the other hand, Ramasamy opined that the ethics from the Kural was
            comparable to the Christian Bible. The Dravidar Kazhagam adopted the Thirukkural and advocated that
            Thiruvalluvar's Kural alone was enough to educate the people of the country. One of Ramasamy's quotes on
            the Thirukkural from Veeramani's Collected Works of Ramasamy was "when Dravida Nadu (Dravidistan) was a
            victim to Indo-Aryan deceit, Thirukkural was written by a great Dravidian Thiruvalluvar to free the
            Dravidians".</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy also asserted that due to the secular nature of Thirukkural, it has the capacity to be
            the common
            book of faith for all humanity and can be kept on par or above the holy books of all religions.</font>
    </p>
    <h4>
        <font size="4">Self-determination of Dravida Nadu</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The Dravidian-Aryan conflict was believed to be a continuous historical phenomenon that started
            when the
            Aryans first set their foot in the Dravidian lands. Even a decade before the idea of separation appeared,
            Ramasamy stated that, "as long as Aryan religion, Indo-Aryan domination, propagation of Aryan Vedas and
            Aryan "Varnashrama" existed, there was need for a "Dravidian Progressive Movement" and a "Self-Respect
            Movement". Ramasamy became very concerned about the growing North Indian domination over the south which
            appeared to him no different from foreign domination. He wanted to secure the fruits of labour of the
            Dravidians to the Dravidians, and lamented that fields such as political, economic, industrial, social, art,
            and spiritual were dominated by the north for the benefit of the North Indians. Thus, with the approach of
            independence from Britain, this fear that North India would take the place of Britain to dominate South
            India became more and more intense.</font>

            <font>Ramasamy with Muhammad Ali Jinnah and B. R. Ambedkar</font>
        </h4>
    </center>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramasamy was clear about the concept of a separate nation, comprising Tamil areas, that is part
            of the
            then existing Madras Presidency with adjoining areas into a federation guaranteeing protection of
            minorities, including religious, linguistic, and cultural freedom of the people. A separatist conference was
            held in June 1940 at Kanchipuram when Ramasamy released the map of the proposed Dravida Nadu, but failed to
            get British approval. On the contrary, Ramasamy received sympathy and support from people such as Bhimrao
            Ramji Ambedkar and Muhammad Ali Jinnah for his views on the Congress, and for his opposition to Hindi. They
            then decided to convene a movement to resist the Congress.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The concept of Dravida Nadu was later modified down to Tamil Nadu. This led to a proposal for a
            union
            of the Tamil people of not only South India but including those of Ceylon as well. In 1953, Ramasamy
            helped to preserve Madras as the capital of Tamil Nadu, which later was the name he substituted for the more
            general Dravida Nadu. In 1955 Ramasamy threatened to burn the national flag, but on Chief Minister
            Kamaraj's pledge that Hindi should not be made compulsory, he postponed the action. In his speech of
            1957 called Suthantara Tamil Nadu En? (Why an independent Tamil Nadu?), he criticised the Central Government
            of India, inducing thousands of Tamilians to burn the constitution of India. The reason for this action was
            that Ramasamy held the Government responsible for maintaining the caste system. After stating reasons for
            separation and turning down opinions against it, he closed his speech with a "war cry" to join and burn the
            map of India on 5 June. Ramasamy was sentenced to six months imprisonment for burning the Indian
            constitution.</font>

            these measures, a Dravida Nadu Separation Day was observed on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous
            arrests. However, Ramasamy resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for
            Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been
            developed to abolish the rights of Tamils. He advocated that there was need to establish a Tamil Nadu
            Freedom Organization and that it was necessary to work towards it.</font>
