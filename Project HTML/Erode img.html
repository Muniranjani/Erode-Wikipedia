            <font size="4" align text="left"> Erode (Tamil: [iːɾoːɽɯ]; īrōṭu), is a city in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is located
                on the banks of the
                Kaveri river and is surrounded by the Western Ghats. Erode is the seventh largest urban agglomeration in
                Tamil
                Nadu. It is the administrative capital of Erode district and is administered by the Erode Municipal
                Corporation
                which was established in 2008.

                The region was ruled by the Cheras during the Sangam period between the 1st and the 4th centuries CE.
                The
                medieval Cholas conquered the region in the 10th century CE. The region was ruled by Vijayanagara Empire
                in the
                15th century followed by the Nayaks who introduced the Palayakkarar system. In the later part of the
                18th
                century, the it came under the Kingdom of Mysore and following the Anglo-Mysore Wars, the British East
                India
                Company annexed it to the Madras Presidency in 1799. The region played a prominent role in the second
                Poligar
                War (1801) when it was the area of operations of Dheeran Chinnamalai.

                Post Indian Independence in 1947, Erode was part of Coimbatore district. It was established as the
                capital of
                the newly formed Erode district in 1979. Erode is a part of Erode Lok Sabha constituency that elects its
                member
                of parliament. Erode is a major agricultural, industrial and educational hub. Erode is among the largest
                producers of turmeric and Erode Turmeric is recognized as Geographical Indications by the Government of
                India.
                The textile boom in the early 20th century and rapid growth due to industrialization has seen Erode
                becoming a
                major producer of handloom and knitwear.</font>

        <font size="5" color="#e36749"><u>Etymology</u></font>
    </h3>
    <p>
        <font size="4">There are two theories regarding the origin of the name Erode. It might have its origin in the
            Tamil phrase Eeru
            Odai meaning two streams based on the presence of two water courses of Perumpallam and Pichaikaranpallam
            Canal.
            Alternatively, it might have been derived from the Tamil phrase Eera Odu meaning 'wet skull' based on Indian
            mythology</font>
    </p>
    <h3>
        <font size="5" color="#e36749"><u>History</u></font>
    </h3>
    <p>
        <font size="4">During Sangam period, the region formed a part of the Kongu Nadu region ruled by Cheras and then
            by
            Kalabhras. The region came under the Pandyas around 590 CE. Afterward, it was ruled by Rashtrakutas and by
            Cholas from the 10th to early 13th century. Erode was annexed by Vijayanagara Empire in 1378 CE till 1559
            CE. After the Vijayanagara Empire fell in the 17th century, the Madurai Nayaks established their state as an
            independent kingdom introducing the Palayakkarar system. Erode became a part of the Hindu Wodeyar-ruled
            Mysore Kingdom in the early 1700s CE before coming under the control of the British East India Company with
            Maharaja of Mysore still as a nominal ruler. Erode remained under British Colonial rule until the Indian
            independence in 1947</font>
