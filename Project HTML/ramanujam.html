        <h2><u>About Srinivasa Ramanujan</u></h2>
    </center>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Srinivasa Ramanujan (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician. Though he had
            almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis,
            number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then
            considered unsolvable.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. According to Hans
            Eysenck, "he
            tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he
            had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not
            be bothered". Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work, in 1913 he began a mail
            correspondence with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England.
            Recognising Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him to travel to Cambridge. In his notes,
            Hardy commented that Ramanujan had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that "defeated me
            completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before", and some recently proven but highly
            advanced results.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities
            and
            equations). Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the
            Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened
            entire new areas of work and inspired further research. Of his thousands of results, most have been
            proven correct. The Ramanujan Journal, a scientific journal, was established to publish work in all areas
            of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan, and his notebooks—containing summaries of his published and
            unpublished results—have been analysed and studied for decades since his death as a source of new
            mathematical ideas. As late as 2012, researchers continued to discover that mere comments in his writings
            about "simple properties" and "similar outputs" for certain findings were themselves profound and subtle
            number theory results that remained unsuspected until nearly a century after his death. He became
            one of the youngest Fellows of the Royal Society and only the second Indian member, and the first Indian to
            be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1919, ill health—now believed to have been hepatic amoebiasis (a complication from episodes of
            dysentery many years previously)—compelled Ramanujan's return to India, where he died in 1920 at the age of
            32. His last letters to Hardy, written in January 1920, show that he was still continuing to produce new
            mathematical ideas and theorems. His "lost notebook", containing discoveries from the last year of his life,
            caused great excitement among mathematicians when it was rediscovered in 1976.</font>

        <font size="4">Early years</font>
    </h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramanujan (literally, "younger brother of Rama", a Hindu deity) was born on 22 December 1887 into
            a
            Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode, in present-day Tamil Nadu. His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa
            Iyengar, originally from Thanjavur district, worked as a clerk in a sari shop. His mother,
            Komalatammal, was a housewife and sang at a local temple. They lived in a small traditional home on
            Sarangapani Sannidhi Street in the town of Kumbakonam. The family home is now a museum. When Ramanujan
            was a year and a half old, his mother gave birth to a son, Sadagopan, who died less than three months later.
            In December 1889, Ramanujan contracted smallpox, but recovered, unlike the 4,000 others who died in a bad
            year in the Thanjavur district around this time. He moved with his mother to her parents' house in
            Kanchipuram, near Madras (now Chennai). His mother gave birth to two more children, in 1891 and 1894, both
            of whom died before their first birthdays.</font>

        </h4>
    </center>
    <p>
        <font size="4">On 1 October 1892, Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school. After his maternal grandfather
            lost his
            job as a court official in Kanchipuram, Ramanujan and his mother moved back to Kumbakonam, and he was
            enrolled in Kangayan Primary School. When his paternal grandfather died, he was sent back to his
            maternal grandparents, then living in Madras. He did not like school in Madras, and tried to avoid
            attending. His family enlisted a local constable to make sure he attended school. Within six months,
            Ramanujan was back in Kumbakonam.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Since Ramanujan's father was at work most of the day, his mother took care of the boy, and they
            had a
            close relationship. From her, he learned about tradition and puranas, to sing religious songs, to attend
            pujas at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habits—all part of Brahmin culture. At Kangayan
            Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary
            examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic with the best scores in the district. That
            year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first
            time.</font>

    </center>
    <p>
        <font size="4">A child prodigy by age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students
            who were
            lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book written by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He
            mastered this by the age of 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he received merit
            certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in
            the logistics of assigning its 1,200 students (each with differing needs) to its approximately 35
            teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with
            geometry and infinite series. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902. He would later
            develop his own method to solve the quartic. In 1903, he tried to solve the quintic, not knowing that it was
            impossible to solve with radicals.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1903, when he was 16, Ramanujan obtained from a friend a library copy of A Synopsis of
            Elementary
            Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, G. S. Carr's collection of 5,000 theorems. Ramanujan
            reportedly studied the contents of the book in detail.[28] The next year, Ramanujan independently developed
            and investigated the Bernoulli numbers and calculated the Euler–Mascheroni constant up to 15 decimal
            places. His peers at the time said they "rarely understood him" and "stood in respectful awe" of him.
        </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">When he graduated from Town Higher Secondary School in 1904, Ramanujan was awarded the K.
            Ranganatha Rao
            prize for mathematics by the school's headmaster, Krishnaswami Iyer. Iyer introduced Ramanujan as an
            outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum. He received a scholarship to study at
            Government Arts College, Kumbakonam, but was so intent on mathematics that he could not focus on any
            other subjects and failed most of them, losing his scholarship in the process.In August 1905, Ramanujan
            ran away from home, heading towards Visakhapatnam, and stayed in Rajahmundry for about a month. He
            later enrolled at Pachaiyappa's College in Madras. There, he passed in mathematics, choosing only to attempt
            questions that appealed to him and leaving the rest unanswered, but performed poorly in other subjects, such
            as English, physiology, and Sanskrit. Ramanujan failed his Fellow of Arts exam in December 1906 and
            again a year later. Without an FA degree, he left college and continued to pursue independent research in
            mathematics, living in extreme poverty and often on the brink of starvation.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1910, after a meeting between the 23-year-old Ramanujan and the founder of the Indian
            Mathematical
            Society, V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, Ramanujan began to get recognition in Madras's mathematical circles, leading to
            his inclusion as a researcher at the University of Madras.</font>

        <font size="4">Adulthood in India</font>
    </h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <font size="4">On 14 July 1909, Ramanujan married Janaki (Janakiammal; 21 March 1899 – 13 April 1994), a girl
            his
            mother had selected for him a year earlier and who was ten years old when they married. It was
            not unusual then for marriages to be arranged with girls at a young age. Janaki was from Rajendram, a
            village close to Marudur (Karur district) Railway Station. Ramanujan's father did not participate in the
            marriage ceremony. As was common at that time, Janaki continued to stay at her maternal home for three
            years after marriage, until she reached puberty. In 1912, she and Ramanujan's mother joined Ramanujan in
            Madras.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">After the marriage, Ramanujan developed a hydrocele testis. The condition could be treated with a
            routine surgical operation that would release the blocked fluid in the scrotal sac, but his family could not
            afford the operation. In January 1910, a doctor volunteered to do the surgery at no cost.</font>

        </h4>
    </center>
    <p>
        <font size="4">After his successful surgery, Ramanujan searched for a job. He stayed at a friend's house while
            he went
            from door to door around Madras looking for a clerical position. To make money, he tutored students at
            Presidency College who were preparing for their Fellow of Arts exam.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In late 1910, Ramanujan was sick again. He feared for his health, and told his friend R.
            Radakrishna Iyer
            to "hand [his notebooks] over to Professor Singaravelu Mudaliar [the mathematics professor at Pachaiyappa's
            College] or to the British professor Edward B. Ross, of the Madras Christian College." After Ramanujan
            recovered and retrieved his notebooks from Iyer, he took a train from Kumbakonam to Villupuram, a city under
            French control. In 1912, Ramanujan moved with his wife and mother to a house in Saiva Muthaiah
            Mudali street, George Town, Madras, where they lived for a few months.In May 1913, upon securing a
            research position at Madras University, Ramanujan moved with his family to Triplicane.</font>

    <h4>
        <font size="4">Pursuit of career in mathematics</font>
    </h4>
    <p>
        <font size="4">In 1910, Ramanujan met deputy collector V. Ramaswamy Aiyer, who founded the Indian Mathematical
            Society. Wishing for a job at the revenue department where Aiyer worked, Ramanujan showed him his
            mathematics notebooks. As Aiyer later recalled:</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">I was struck by the extraordinary mathematical results contained in [the notebooks]. I had no
            mind to
            smother his genius by an appointment in the lowest rungs of the revenue department.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Aiyer sent Ramanujan, with letters of introduction, to his mathematician friends in Madras. Some
            of
            them looked at his work and gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector
            for Nellore and the secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by
            Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with
            Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of
            his work but concluded that he was not a fraud. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell
            Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as
            Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao
            said ultimately convinced him of Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan
            replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his
            research with Rao's financial aid. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the
            Indian Mathematical Society.</font>

        <font size="4">Ramanujan departed from Madras aboard the S.S. Nevasa on 17 March 1914. When he disembarked in
            London on 14 April, Neville was waiting for him with a car. Four days later, Neville took him to his house
            on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six
            weeks, Ramanujan moved out of Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a five-minute walk
            from Hardy's room.</font>

        </h4>
    </center>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Hardy and Littlewood began to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120
            theorems from
            Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy
            saw that some were wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new breakthroughs.
            Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and Littlewood. Littlewood commented, "I can believe that he's at
            least a Jacobi", while Hardy said he "can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramanujan spent nearly five years in Cambridge collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and
            published part
            of his findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting personalities. Their collaboration was a
            clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades, the foundations of
            mathematics had come into question and the need for mathematically rigorous proofs was recognised. Hardy was
            an atheist and an apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a deeply religious man who
            relied very strongly on his intuition and insights. Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's
            education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support his results, without hindering his
            inspiration—a conflict that neither found easy.</font>

            March 1916 for his work on highly composite numbers, sections of the first part of which had been published
            the preceding year in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society. The paper was more than 50 pages
            long and proved various properties of such numbers. Hardy disliked this topic area but remarked that though
            it engaged with what he called the 'backwater of mathematics', in it Ramanujan displayed 'extraordinary
            mastery over the algebra of inequalities'.</font>

            elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, the second Indian admitted, after Ardaseer Cursetjee in 1841. At
            age 31, Ramanujan was one of the youngest Fellows in the Royal Society's history. He was elected "for his
            investigation in elliptic functions and the Theory of Numbers." On 13 October 1918, he was the first Indian
            to be elected a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.</font>

        <font size="4">Illness and death</font>
    </h4>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramanujan had numerous health problems throughout his life. His health worsened in England;
            possibly he
            was also less resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary requirements of his religion
            there and because of wartime rationing in 1914–18. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and a severe vitamin
            deficiency, and confined to a sanatorium. He attempted suicide in late 1917 or early 1918 by jumping on the
            tracks of a London underground station. Scotland Yard arrested him for attempting suicide (which was a
            crime), but released him after Hardy intervened. In 1919, Ramanujan returned to Kumbakonam, Madras
            Presidency, where he died in 1920 aged 32. After his death, his brother Tirunarayanan compiled Ramanujan's
            remaining handwritten notes, consisting of formulae on singular moduli, hypergeometric series and continued
            fractions. In his last days, though in severe pain, "he continued doing his mathematics filling sheet
            after sheet with numbers", Janaki Ammal recounts.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramanujan's widow, Smt. Janaki Ammal, moved to Bombay. In 1931, she returned to Madras and
            settled in
            Triplicane, where she supported herself on a pension from Madras University and income from tailoring. In
            1950, she adopted a son, W. Narayanan, who eventually became an officer of the State Bank of India and
            raised a family. In her later years, she was granted a lifetime pension from Ramanujan's former employer,
            the Madras Port Trust, and pensions from, among others, the Indian National Science Academy and the state
            governments of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. She continued to cherish Ramanujan's memory, and
            was active in efforts to increase his public recognition; prominent mathematicians, including George
            Andrews, Bruce C. Berndt and Béla Bollobás made it a point to visit her while in India. She died at her
            Triplicane residence in 1994</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">A 1994 analysis of Ramanujan's medical records and symptoms by D. A. B. Young concluded that his
            medical symptoms—including his past relapses, fevers, and hepatic conditions—were much closer to those
            resulting from hepatic amoebiasis, an illness then widespread in Madras, than tuberculosis. He had two
            episodes of dysentery before he left India. When not properly treated, amoebic dysentery can lie dormant for
            years and lead to hepatic amoebiasis, whose diagnosis was not then well established. At the time, if
            properly diagnosed, amoebiasis was a treatable and often curable disease;[105][106] British soldiers who
            contracted it during the First World War were being successfully cured of amoebiasis around the time
            Ramanujan left England</font>

    <p>
        <font size="4">Ramanujan has been described as a person of a somewhat shy and quiet disposition, a dignified man
            with
            pleasant manners. He lived a simple life at Cambridge. Ramanujan's first Indian biographers
            describe him as a rigorously orthodox Hindu. He credited his acumen to his family goddess, Namagiri Thayar
            (Goddess Mahalakshmi) of Namakkal. He looked to her for inspiration in his work and said he dreamed of
            blood drops that symbolised her consort, Narasimha. Later he had visions of scrolls of complex mathematical
            content unfolding before his eyes. He often said, "An equation for me has no meaning unless it

        <font size="4">Hardy cites Ramanujan as remarking that all religions seemed equally true to him.[114] Hardy
            further
            argued that Ramanujan's religious belief had been romanticised by Westerners and overstated—in reference to
            his belief, not practice—by Indian biographers. At the same time, he remarked on Ramanujan's strict
            vegetarianism.</font>

        <font size="4">Similarly, in an interview with Frontline, Berndt said, "Many people falsely promulgate mystical
            powers to
            Ramanujan's mathematical thinking. It is not true. He has meticulously recorded every result in his three
            notebooks," further speculating that Ramanujan worked out intermediate results on slate that he could not
            afford the paper to record more permanently.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Berndt reported that Janaki said in 1984 that Ramanujan spent so much of his time on mathematics
            that he
            did not go to the temple, that she and her mother often fed him because he had no time to eat, and that most
            of the religious stories attributed to him originated with others. However, his orthopraxy was not in doubt.

        <font size="4"> The year after his death, Nature listed Ramanujan among other distinguished scientists and
            mathematicians
            on a "Calendar of Scientific Pioneers" who had achieved eminence.[134] Ramanujan's home state of Tamil Nadu
            celebrates 22 December (Ramanujan's birthday) as 'State IT Day'. Stamps picturing Ramanujan were issued by
            the government of India in 1962, 2011, 2012 and 2016.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Since Ramanujan's centennial year, his birthday, 22 December, has been annually celebrated as
            Ramanujan
            Day by the Government Arts College, Kumbakonam, where he studied, and at the IIT Madras in Chennai. The
            International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) has created a prize in Ramanujan's name for young
            mathematicians from developing countries in cooperation with the International Mathematical Union, which
            nominates members of the prize committee. SASTRA University, a private university based in Tamil Nadu, has
            instituted the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize of US$10,000 to be given annually to a mathematician not exceeding age
            32 for outstanding contributions in an area of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan.</font>

        <font size="4">Based on the recommendations of a committee appointed by the University Grants Commission (UGC),
            Government of India, the Srinivasa Ramanujan Centre, established by SASTRA, has been declared an off-campus
            centre under the ambit of SASTRA University. House of Ramanujan Mathematics, a museum of Ramanujan's life
            and work, is also on this campus. SASTRA purchased and renovated the house where Ramanujan lived at
            Kumabakonam.</font>

        <font size="4">In 2011, on the 125th anniversary of his birth, the Indian government declared that 22 December
            will be
            celebrated every year as National Mathematics Day. Then Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also
            declared that 2012 would be celebrated as National Mathematics Year and 22 December as National Mathematics
            Day of India.</font>

        <font size="4">Ramanujan IT City is an information technology (IT) special economic zone (SEZ) in Chennai that was built
            in 2011. Situated next to the Tidel Park, it includes 25 acres (10 ha) with two zones, with a total area of
            5.7 million square feet (530,000 m2), including 4.5 million square feet (420,000 m2) of office space.</font>
