        <font size="4">Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve is a protected area and tiger reserve located along the area
            straddling both
            the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats in the Erode district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.The
            Sathyamangalam Forest Division is part of the Bramhagiri-Nilgiris-Eastern Ghats Elephant Reserve notified in
            2003. In 2008, part of the Sathyamangalam Forest Division was declared a wildlife sanctuary, which was
            further enlarged in 2011 to cover a forest area of 1,411.6 km2 (545.0 sq mi). It is the largest wildlife
            sanctuary in Tamil Nadu. In 2013, an area of 1,408.6 km2 (543.9 sq mi) of the erstwhile sanctuary was
            notified as a tiger reserve and it was the fourth tiger reserve established in the state as a part of
            Project Tiger.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The reserve is a significant ecosystem and a wildlife corridor in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve
            between
            the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats and a genetic link between the five other protected areas which it
            adjoins, including the Sigur Plateau, Mudumalai and Bandipur National Parks, Billigiriranga Swamy Temple and
            Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuaries. The reserve covers parts of Sathyamangalam and Gobichettipalayam taluks of
            Erode district in western Tamil Nadu.

        </font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The reserve had a tiger population of 80 individuals in 2018 which was 25 in 2011. In 2022, the
            reserve
            won the TX2 award by World Wide Fund in collaboration with wildlife conservation agencies for its growth in
            tiger population.</font>

    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Patches of sandalwood reserves including the Sathyamangalam forests were notified under the
            Indian Forest
            Act, 1927. The forests were part of the erstwhile Coimbatore district with a range officer at Sathyamangalam
            and eight guards. The forest division is currently located in Erode district and forms a part of the
            Brahmagiri-Nilgiris-Eastern Ghats elephant reserve notified in 2003. Sathyamangalam Forest Division was
            declared a wildlife sanctuary with effect from 3 November 2008 by the Government of Tamil Nadu as per the
            Wild Life Protection Act of 1972. In 2008, the Government of Karnataka sent a proposal to declare the
            contiguous Billigiriranga Swamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve which was subsequently approved
            in 2010.In a wildlife survey conducted by the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2010, 46 tigers were
            sighted in the Sathyamangalam forest area. In July 2010, the Minister of State for Environment and
            Forests of the Government of India requested the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to consider the possibility of
            proposing the Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary as a Project Tiger reserve as per the provisions of the
            Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 as the area is contiguous with the forests of Bandipur and Mudumalai tiger
            reserves. On 1 April 2010, the Government of Tamil Nadu announced that it would initiate the process
            to declare the sanctuary as a tiger reserve because of the consistent sighting of tigers in the forest area
            and that the declaration would strengthen wildlife conservation efforts, as the central government would
            provide additional financial support for the appointment of additional anti-poaching watchers and for the
            establishment of anti-poaching camps.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">On 10 March 2011, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests said that the proposal for according
            tiger
            reserve status for the Sathyamangalam reserve forests is under consideration. He said that studies using
            camera traps indicated there could be 19 to 25 tigers in the forests. A 2011 camera trap tiger density study
            conducted by World Wildlife Fund indicated that the sanctuary is home to at least 25 tigers. In the same
            year, a DNA based project initiated by the state forest department collected 150 samples of pugmarks from
            the Sathyamangalam forests and 69 of them were found positive for tigers by tests conducted at the Centre
            for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. The findings also indicated that the region was home to as
            many as 30 tigers.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">Supported by the reports of tiger sightings, the Tamil Nadu Forest Department submitted a
            detailed report
            to the state government supporting the proposal to declare the sanctuary as a tiger reserve and the proposal
            was taken up for consideration by the Tamil Nadu Council of Ministers in early 2012. On 6 April 2012,
            the Chief Wildlife Warden said that the proposal to declare Sathyamangalam as a tiger reserve has been sent
            to the Ministry of Environment and Forests for approval and funding. In March 2013, the Government of
            India issued an order declaring the Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary as the fourth tiger reserve in the
            state, with the other three being Mudumalai, Indira Gandhi National Park and Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger
            Reserve.</font>

        <font size="4">The total area originally declared as a sanctuary was 524.3494 km2 (202.4524 sq mi). The
            boundaries of the
            sanctuary were the Thalavadi range of Thalamalai forests and Hasanur, T.N.Palayam ranges of
            Gobichettipalayam taluk of Guthiyalathur forests, contiguous with Billigiriranga Swamy Temple Wildlife
            Sanctuary in the north and the rivers of Moyar and Bhavani, contiguous with Mudumalai National Park and
            Sigur Plateau in the south. The eastern boundary is formed by the Bargur reserved forests in Anthiyur taluk
            and Bandipur National Park in the west. The sanctuary includes the areas of Guthiyalathur reserved forests
            (299.47 km2 (115.63 sq mi)), Guthiyalathur extension (1.62 km2 (0.63 sq mi)), Thalamalai reserved forests

            Thalamalai reserve forests, thus increasing the total sanctuary area to 1,411.6 km2 (545.0 sq mi). Of
            the total area, the core zone comprises 917.27 km2 (354.16 sq mi) reserved forests and tourism is allowed in
            the buffer zone with only forest officials permitted entry into the core zone.</font>

        <font size="4">The Sathyamangalam forest is mostly tropical dry forest, part of the South Deccan Plateau dry
            deciduous
            forests ecoregion. There are five distinct forest types: tropical evergreen (Shola), semi-evergreen,
            mixed-deciduous, dry deciduous and thorn forests. Evergreen forests are restricted to small patches in a
            few high altitude hill tops of Sathyamamgalam between 750 m (2,460 ft) and 1,649 m (5,410 ft). These patches
            are threatened on account of land use changing to hill agriculture and plantation crops, including fruit.
            Semi-evergreen forests are found at high altitude. Mixed and dry deciduous forests are located on middle
            altitude slopes and the thorn forests are usually found in the foothills and some times, due degradation of
            dry deciduous forests, at the middle elevations. About 65% of the forest division is under forest cover.
            Significant areas of mixed shrubland and grasslands support a large population of herbivore ungulates, the
            preferred prey of tigers.</font>

            of
            Tamil Nadu stated that the sanctuary is home to at least 28 tigers as confirmed by a camera trap study
            conducted by World Wildlife Fund. In the 2012 national wildlife survey, 25 tigers were recorded. In
            2018, 80 tigers were recorded. In 2022, the reserve won the TX2 award by World Wide Fund in collaboration

    <p>
        <font size="4">Conservation of the Sathyamangalam Forest Division is administered by the Tamil Nadu Forest
            Department
            governed through Conservator of Forests, STR-Erode. The wildlife sanctuary is part of Project Tiger and
            Project Elephant conservation programmes run by the Government of India. The sanctuary is listed
            among the top five places in India for poaching tigers by the international wild life trade monitoring
            network, TRAFFIC. In February 2016, the National Tiger Conservation Authority announced that drones will
            be used to monitor tiger population in five tiger reserves including Sathyamangalam.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The reserve also faces issues due to forest fires, uncontrolled grazing of cattle and growth of
            invasive
            plant species, damaging the ecosystem. Man-animal conflicts are common especially with elephants and
            leopards. Elephants raid crop fields and illegal electric fences used to protect crops mortally wound
            elephants and five elephants were electrocuted in three-month period between January and April 2013.
            As of 2011, solar powered fencing that give a short and safe electric shock was laid over a length of 239 km
            (149 mi) to prevent the entry of elephants into agricultural lands. The state forest department also dug
            trenches at a cost of ₹1.51 crore (US$180,000) to prevent the elephants from entering human habitats.
            Leopards prey on domestic cattle with as many as 27 goats killed by them in a single month in November
            2012. National highway 948 passes through the wildlife sanctuary and wildlife deaths have been reported
            due to vehicular movement in the highway at night.</font>

    </h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <font szie="4">Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve forests are home to indigenous tribal people belonging largely to
            the Irulas,
            also known as the Urali, and Soliga communities. In 2011, the Tamil Nadu state forest department
            officials conducted a study on the cattle and human population in the seven forest settlements and 12
            revenue settlements inside the protected area. As of 2013, tribals engage in collecting honey, more than
            900 families live in 138 villages within a 5 km (3.1 mi) radius surrounding the park. Tribal people
            engage in agriculture, grazing of animals and collecting minor forest produce such as honey, tubers, fuel
            wood and fish. According to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of
            Forest Rights) Act, 2006, the tribals were entitled to use designated land within the park area for
            agriculture and the title deeds for the same are to be distributed within 2016 after the Supreme Court of
            India vacated a stay order issued by the Madras High Court prohibiting the same.</font>
    </p>
    <p>
        <font size="4">The forests were also the home of notorious criminal and bandit Veerapan, who made a living by poaching,
            smuggling ivory and sandalwood from the forests and selling them on the black market. Veerapan was killed by
            the Tamil Nadu Police in October 2004</font>
