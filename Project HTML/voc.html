            Erode in
            Tamil Nadu. The park is owned and maintained by Erode Municipal Corporation. This park was built during the
            British India period by chairman Srinivasa Mudaliar. This park was previously known as Srinivasaa Park.

        <font size="4">The park was constructed in 1912 with a land spread of 25 acres (10 ha), when Thanthai Periyar
            was the
            Chairman of Erode Municipal Council. The original idea of the park was developed as a part of the drinking
            water project for the town. Erode Municipality built a small reservoir named Pechiparai to store water
            from the river Kaveri and four tanks in the form of towers joined with a wall. A garden was established
            in its vicinity, named after the then Municipal Chairman Srinivasa Mudaliar. With the succession of Sheikh
            Dawood as the next Municipal Chairman, he renamed the place to Peoples' Park and added a Mini-Zoo to it.

        <font size="4">The park has gardens, two lakes, fountains, and walkways. A mini-zoo recognized by the Central
            Zoo
            Authority was established in the park in 1992. However, due to improper maintenance, it was closed in
            2007. In 2007, the Erode Municipal Corporation developed a Science Park at a cost of â‚¹13 lakh, opposite
            the main park. The Science Park, also known as Children's Park, was developed with the aim of improving
            play-oriented knowledge for kids. A toy train ride was available until 2007 but is not operational
            now. The Erode Municipal Corporation has opened an Amma Unavagam at the second gate of VOC Park.</font>
